# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose 

PyCity Schools executed standardized testing of the students at all high schools. After an initial analysis of the scores in the test was completed, evidence of academic dishonesty within the 9th grade at Thomas High School was uncovered. The data was then refactored to remove the 9th grade results from Thomas High school, in order to produce analysis of the district at large without being affected by the scores impacted by academic dishonestly. The present report seeks to show differences between the original analysis and the final analysis, and describe how the 9th grade Thomas High School removals impacted the overall analysis.

## Results

### District Summary

The District Summary values are very slightly altered by removing the scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School. The overall passing percentage decreased from 65.2% of the district to 64.9% of the district. Average math and reading scores changed by much less that one percent, and the percent passing math and reading at the district level decreased by 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.

Note that the number of schools, students, and budget did not change with removal of the scores. This is because the students in 9th grade at Thomas High School still command budget, still go to school, and of course still exist.
