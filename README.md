# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose 

PyCity Schools executed standardized testing of the students at all high schools. After an initial analysis of the scores in the test was completed, evidence of academic dishonesty within the 9th grade at Thomas High School was uncovered. The data was then refactored to remove the 9th grade results from Thomas High school, in order to produce analysis of the district at large without being affected by the scores impacted by academic dishonestly. The present report seeks to show differences between the original analysis and the final analysis, and describe how the 9th grade Thomas High School removals impacted the overall analysis.
